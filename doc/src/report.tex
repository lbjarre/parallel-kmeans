\section{$k$-means clustering}
$k$-means clustering is a data clustering method which clusters input data into $k$ different classes.
The classes are represented by the class means $\mu_i$ and points are considered to be in a class $S_i$
if the squared distance to the class mean is the minimum
compared to the squared distance to the other class means.
Formally:
\[
  S_i = \{ x \in X : ||x - \mu_i||^2 \leq ||x - \mu_j||^2 \forall 1 \leq j \leq k \}
\]
$k$-means finds the placement of the class means
by minimization of the summed squared distance of all class points to the class mean for all $k$ classes:
\[
  \argmin_S \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x \in S_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2
\]
A common algorithm to find this is Lloyd's algorithm,
which iteratively classifies points according to current class means
and updates them with the average of all classified points until convergence.
